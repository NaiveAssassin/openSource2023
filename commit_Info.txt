    Fix Minion stats values (#7253)
    
    * Fix Base minion Attack damage values
    
    We were using the incorrect column in DefaultMonsterStats
    The damage difference is ~20% less at level 70 vs the default monster damage table.
    
    I'm not sure if this should apply to Spectre skills so will need to confirm with GGG
    
    Damage now lines up with the SRS damage from this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhh3rQ54_CsRPC37PLqlr_XPIlhy26HP7PjFHSJbUco/edit?usp=sharing
    
    * Support new life tables / fixup multi / base damage flag
    
    Adds support for minons to use the alternate life tables
    Fixes the handling of the DamageFixup stat
    Add support for handling the baseDamageIgnoresAttackSpeed on some minions
    
    * Remove fixup as it should apply elsewhere
    
    * Export minion evasion multipliers
    
    * Export Game constants
    
    * Use correct formulas for evasion and armour
    
    Evasion and Armour values were quite wrong with the previous formula
    Could technically change the evasion formula to be 100% correct but I believe it's better just just use the look up table and be 99.5% correct and be a bit more performant
    Not 100% sure on the Accuracy table though and need to check with Openarl

    Fix Law of the Wilds using the wrong minion stats (#7254)
    
    Law of the Wilds was using the wrong base minion for its stats so the damage was very far off.
    
    It was also using the wrong actor level for the minion and I believe it always grabs the level from the `levelRequirement` stat and the `base_display_minion_actor_level` is only used for the tooltip in game but not the actual minion itself.
    The only other minion with differing `base_display_minion_actor_level ` vs `levelrequirement` is Vaal Summon Skeletons. I'll will check this assumption with GGG

    Sort the Calculations Tab breakdown lists by value (#7211)
    
    * Sort the CalcBreakdownControl list by value.
    
    There is already a sort by type, but this is not used for a lot of
    breakdowns. Applying a sort by value should make it easier to read the
    breakdown without disrupting the sort by type.
    
    * Sort the CalcBreakdownControl taking in consideration boolean values.
    
    Some breakdowns can contain a mix of `number` and `boolean`. e.g. the skill buffs breakdown if you have a golem active will have a `Condition: have golem` with value of `true`.
    
    The values in this kind of breakdown are pretty sparse and sorting them in a coherent way is not easy, so for the sake of this PR we can just keep skip(return false) when comparing number and boolean.
    
    * Use a copy of the modList in CalcBreakdownControl
    
    If we try to sort on the original modlist, we'll actually change the order of the values in memory and next time we sort again, some of the mods can move position.
    
    Using a copy of the table--which will be discarded after use--will prevent this.
    
    * Sort generic breakdown and slots
    
    Breakdowns can also accept direct breakdown tables and slots values. These also need to be sorted by value.

    It would be possible to add stats for all other possible charges, but it would take quite a bit of space, and it would not offer much useful information as apart from the `Charge Duration Mastery` and the `Swift Killer` ascendancy node, there isn't much affecting them.

    Fix Dual Strike of Ambidexterity not using offhand attack time (#7097)
    
    This overrides the attack speed value to only use the speed from the offhand
    It does have the issue where changing the attack speed on the main hand weapon shows a DPS change in the tooltip but not when saved.
    I'm not sure how to fix the tooltip

    The gem did not have the area tag on it.
    I added it and separated the skill parts so area modifiers would not apply to the hit portion

    Fix The Adorned not applying to jewels in outer tree sockets (#7086)
    
    The check for if the jewel came from the tree was coupled to the check to see if it was an expansion jewel so it didn't stop the jewel applying to Abyssal sockets on gear
    The only way I could see to get the jewel to apply to outer tree sockets was to make sure it didn't have a parent attribute in the expansionJewel attribute

    New save format (#7050)
    
    * New save format
    
    Uses the Path of Exile BaseItemType.Id for the gem in gemId (as it always has been).
    The skillId attribute is also kept and maps to the gems variant primary GrantedEffect.Id.
    Adds a new attribute called variantId that maps to the variant of the game, eg. Arc, ArcAltX, or ArcAltY. This is to help identify which variant is used rather than relying on every gem variant having its own unique granted effect.
    
    For the majority of gems skillId and variantId are the same, but it is not true for every case.
    
    * Remove redundant nil check

    Fix Crash when using the Adorned and items with abyssal sockets (#7054)
    
    The code was crashing as it was not making sure that the jewel socket was from the tree before trying to check if it was an expansion jewel socket.
    Also moved the multiplier check first, as it is pointless to have the jewel and rarity check if The Adorned is not in the build in the first place

    Fix Pyroclast Mine Aura Effect scaling Maximum Added Flat Damage (#7005)
    
    The max flat damage stat did not have the unscalable flag added to it
    Had a look and applied it to some other skills that also used a similar limit variable although those would only scale with buff effect so was unlikely to become an issue

    Fix Phantasmal Flameblast AoE values (#6813)
    
    Phantasmal Flameblast grants base radius to the gem as its quality effect. It used the `active_skill_base_radius_+` stat to grant the extra base radius which was stat mapped to `skill("radiusExtra", nil)`.
    This would be overwritten by the stat map on the gem that also used `radiusExtra` instead of summing the values together. Changed the statMap on the gem to use `mod("AreaOfEffect", "BASE")` instead so it sums correctly

    Fix Divergent Arcane Cloak (#6695)
    
    Divergent Arcane Cloak was scaling the added damage by a per stat instead of a percentage stat.
    This adds support for using a multiplier variable in place of the percentage value.
    Also did some testing in game and Arcane Cloak and other similar effects appear to round up the final value so changed that logic too

    Fix ModCache using default affix quality setting
    
    The ModCache was using the value set for `Default item affix quality` and always regenerating with 70% as the mid value as that's what I had mine set to
    I'd like there to be some way where it regenerates for the user based on their settings

    Display AoE values as metres (#6624)
    
    Converts all output breakdowns of units to instead use metres
    Adds support for the new mod parsings so they work correctly
    I decided on creating variables that just convert the final value for the output to the calcs / sidebar so all the internal calculations still use units. I made sure that everything still used units so if we want to switch everything to metres it should be quite clear
    Added support for the stat on Fireball that gains radius over range

    Fix Trauma Rate doubling when dual wielding (#6623)
    
    The block the code was in ran twice as it would run once for each weapon. This divides the rate in 2 when dual wielding before adding it to the multiplier
    Also fixes the breakdowns as they were very clustered before and included unnecessary values
    Added the noTotal part to multiChain breakdowns so it doesn't show the total value when you don't want to appear

    Fix Bleed/Ignite Stack potential issues (#6386)
    
    The config was not affecting the number of bleeds/ignites affecting the enemy and was instead only affecting the average roll %
    Ignite and Bleed roll % was not calculated to be at least 50% roll as a minimum
    Ignite was also not taking into account Hit Chance when calculating the average roll
    Breakdowns were improved to show the potential when max stacks is more than 1

    This just temporarily fixes the issue before we find the root cause

    Add proper support for DPS with Scourge Arrow, Divine Ire, Flameblast and Incinerate (#6245)
    
    * Add proper support for DPS with Channeled skills that use stages
    
    Channeling skills that used stages did not have their hit rate modified by the time it took to channel those stages
    This PR adds `hitTimeMultiplier` values for Scourge Arrow, Divine Ire, Flameblast and Incinerate
    Snipe is handled in it's own PR
    This shows the channel time in the sidebar along with the correct hit rate for these skills
    Adds boxes to the config page to set the number of nearby enemies for Divine Ire to calculate the correct charge rate
    
    * Fix breakdowns

    Fix "Cannot be Blinded" interaction with "You are Blind" keystone (#6162)
    
    * Fix Cannot be Blinded interaction with You are Blind keystone
    
    'Cannot be Blinded' takes priority over 'You are Blind'
    This does not fix all interacts that depend on if the player is blind however. I'm not sure of a nice universal way to disable them all instead of having to add a neg = true condition to every mod
    Should perhaps add back the avoid mod as well as the flag, not too sure
    
    * Support for other player blinded conditions

    Do not modify env.configInput.conditionLeching directly (#6126)
    
    Currently with overleech env.configInput.conditionLeeching is modified
    directly resulting in default value checks failing on it as it was
    changed to non-default value not by user input. This force adjustment of
    configInput is unnecessary and it looks like just modifying condList is

    Highlight borders for changed config options in config tab (#5717)
    
    This highlights borders for controls for changed config options when
    they are in non-default state. Useful for quickly checking what options
    user configured and prevents forgetting about some config set by
    accident (dropdowns in non-default state are especially hard to spot)

    mods to fix this.

    Added support for Doom Blast (from Impending Doom) (#5530)
    
    * Added support for Doom Blast (from Impending Doom)
    * Now shows DPS instead of average damage
    * You can now pick overlap count (for spell cascade)
    * Support gems no longer get levels from "+# to Level of Active Skill Gems" and similar
    * getTriggerActionTriggerRate() no longer adjusts to tick rate for skills that can store several uses (which Doom Blast can)
    * Added a config checkbox for Vixen's Entrapment to cap Doom Blast trigger rate when cast speed is too high
    
    * Impending Doom improvements:
    * Overlap now instead uses stages so that the user can set any overlap count
    * Updated Vixen's Entrapment item text
    * "Use Vixen's Entrapment cooldown?" is now automatically checked when equipping the gloves
    
    * Impending Doom: Reverting changes to getTriggerActionTriggerRate() and made it specific to Doom Blast only.
    
    * Impending Doom: some cleanup.
    
    * Parse the cooldown on Vixen's Entrapment rather than hard code it.
    
    * TriggerCurseOnCurseCooldown -> VixensCurseOnCurseCooldown
    
    * Stop rounding of cooldown to server ticks if skill has extra uses

    Hide config options that can be hidden by default behind conditions (#5712)
    
    Config changes:
    
    - Remove "Is your Crit Chance Lucky?" - The only sources can already be
      enabled with existing conditions and the lucky is implied after that
      (Blood Sacrament, Focus Mod, Dance with Death)
    - Only show "# of times skill has chained" if there is condition behind
      it (Gloomfang for example)
    - Only show "# of times skill has pierced" if there is condition behind
      it (Drillneck for example)
    - Only show "melee distance to enemy" if there is stat that depends on
      melee proximity (Close Combat, Slayer for example)
    - Only show "projectile travel distance if there is stat that depends on
      distance ramp (Point Blank, Longshot for example)
    - Only show "is enemy bleeding" if there is condition behind it
      (Bloodletting for example)
    - Only show "# of poison on enemy" if there is condition behind it (Vile
      Toxins for example)A
    - Only show "is the enemy maimed" if there is condition behind it (Maim
      support for example)
    - Only show "is enemy burning" if there is condition behind it
    - Only show "is enemy ignited" if there is condition behind it
      (Snowforged for example)
    - Only show "is enemy frozen" if there is condition behind it
    - Only show "effect of shock" if enemy is shocked
    - Only show "is enemy on consecrated ground" if there is condition
      behind it (Bottled Faith for example)
    - Only show "disable ehp gain on block" if there are any on block
      effects
    - Only show "life regen mode" if there is effect that depends on it (Enduring Cry etc)
    - Only show "armour calculation mode" if there is effect that depends on it (armour mastery etc)
    - Only show "enemy corpse life" if there is skill that depends on it
      (Cremation, Detonate Dead)
    - Only show "# of summoned totems" if there is perstat or enemy mult
      that depends on it
    - Only show "is enemy moving" if player has bleedchance
    - Only show "Don't disable items" if there are items that are disabling
      stuff
    
    New functionality:
    
    - ifStat and ifEnemyStat for PerStat and StatCondition config checks
    - ifTagType for tag type config checks
    - if SkillData for skill data config checks
    - config tab now supports multiple if checks at once
    - Replaced all ifXList with support for type checking the value so if value is list it will be treated as list of OR checks. This works for all ifX conditions in config tab instead of only specific ones that had list support before
    - Do not account for "Base" mods (mods from CalcSetup) as actual used
      conditions as they are used only as descriptors for what the mods do
    - IfMod can now only account for presence of mod regardless of flags and conditions

    Fix crash caused by very long lines without spaces (#5785)
    
    * FIX: line wrap crash
    
    * FIX: move last break var calculation
    
    Even though the `s > #str` check should prevent any crashes
    that could happen due to `lastBreak` being nil as it should break out of the loop
    before then; Moving the initialization of that variable above the place it is used should
    guarantee that this will not crash in cases i've not considered.

    wrapper is ran from github workflows but should not be set when other

    Max hit improvement (#5196)
    
    * Remove usage of magic numbers for damage in max hit calculations
    
    Max hit taken should not depend on enemy damage. This mostly affects how armour is involved in max hit calculations.
    
    * Max hit adjustment with taken-as conversions
    
    Apply some better approximation to taken-as max hit calculations
    
    * Add some tests
    
    * Bigger breakdown and more sprinkles of magic
    
    Moved damage conversion into math part, which allows it to handle elemental taken as elemental better. Improved approximation a bit. If approximation was used, report some more details about it in the breakdown.
    
    * One part of the max hit breakdown was using old value
    
    So refurbished half of the breakdown to have a bit more relevant information.

    * Merge #4761 + Change default gem level list order
    
    Merged "Hide gems when using match gems to character level if they are above character level" from #4761 by @QuickStick123
    
    Reordered default gem level list so "normal maximum" is first, as "match character level" has potentially confusing behavior (hiding gems below character level) that users need to opt-in to.

    * Rebuild sort cache on defaultLevel change
    
    .. and skip rebuilding sort cache on character level change if we don't care about the character level.
    
    * Fix default gem level missing initialization
    
    .. and slightly improve sortCache behavior.
    
    * Misc formatting improvements
    
    * Call PopulateGemList() on sortCache initialization
    
    This fixes a bug where the gem list was never initialized correctly on new/empty socket groups.
    
    * Update GemSelectControl.lua
    
    * Handle legacy configuration settings

    Fix Aura effect on Self not counting towards Aura effect breakdown (#4977)
    
    Aura effect on Self from Sublime Vision, Purposeful Harbinger or from the Aura mastery were not counting towards the value in the Aura effect breakdown
    This PR does have the issue where if you have something like Generosity linked to a skill, it correctly does not add  aura effect on self mods to the total aura effect value but it does still show them in the breakdown table. I'm not sure how to have them disappear from the table when the aura does not affect the player

    Making this PR did make me realise that if we wanted to generate more uniques from the ggpk, we need a different and more efficient way of doing things

    Fix Vaal Discipline not counting towards Aura count (#4608)
    
    When GGG changed the file format to use Constant stats they removed the previously unused stat of `base_maximum_energy_shield` so it made Vaal Discipline no longer count towards mods like `Auras from your Skills grant x`. This adds a Dummy stat to fix that issue
    The stat name is `EnergyShieldRechargeNotDelayedByDamage` so when it shows up under the `Aura and Buff Skills` section, it is clear to users what the mod is

    Fix undo resetting active display group (#4554)
    
    - Properly create undo state while 100% preserving same indices
      (probably unnecessary but I noticed that I was relying on ordered
      index)
    - Move getting displayId from displayGroup at start of restore undo
      method (like before) so it can get the position before the values are
      replaced and instance comparison is no longer possible. Without this
      change display group always resets on undo

    Add zoom support by using shift + mouse (#4355)
    
    * Add zoom support by using shift + mouse
    
    This adds support to zoom in and out in any `EditControl`.
    
    Main usage for this is the `Notes` section, which can be kinda hard to read on high resolutions.
    
    Many build authors meanwhile use this area to describe detailed step-by-step leveling guides with a build and having the screen open while reading is probably an regular usecase. Beeing able to zoom in here might help alot of ppl.
    
    For now I only enabled zooming for the notes. Not sure whether other editors (like editing details in the crafting screen would benefit from it also).
    
    * Fix tabs vs spaces
    
    * Refactored zooming
    
    * Added min/max values for zooming
    * switched from SHIFT to CTRL
    * Add support for CTRL +/-/0
    
    * Update src/Classes/NotesTab.lua

    Unify Max Stages to not use StagesAfterFirst anymore (#4306)
    
    Setting the maximum number of stages now sets the limit for both `Stages` and `StagesAfterFirst` multipliers.
    Previously to use a `StagesAfterFirst` multiplier you also had to have a `MaxStagesAfterFirst`. Now you only need `MaxStages` for any skill
    This also fixes the issue where on loading explosive arrow, the skill would have 0 damage as the `base = -100` value was applying incorrectly

    Fix Kinetic Bolt not fully scaling with Spell Damage/Cast Speed
    
    The configuration for Kinetic Bolt was setting the value of the spell damage/cast speed scaling mods as increases, rather than max values as they're read in CalcOffence. This lead to them being always treated at 100% scaling rather than the correct 200% for spell damage and 2.5%*quality for cast speed.

    Add Delirium effect scaling (#4134)
    
    * Add Delirium effect scaling
    
    Delirium scales mob `Damage taken` and mob `Damage dealt` by certain values discovered in this post
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/pkgeg8/delirium_scaling/
    
    Changed it to be `Less player damage` as that is effectively the same as `Less damage taken` I believe. I could be wrong here
    
    * Add tooltip and change damage from player to enemy
    
    * Update Damage Taken values
    
    Update values to use `deliriumPercent * 0.96`

    * Add support for Petrified Blood EHP
    
    This adds support for Petrified Blood life loss prevention to EHP calcs
    in similar fashion as Mind over Matter. The prevention gain is checked
    against being at low life or not, below low life it will use full value
    (e.g 40 base) above full life it will use halved value (Pathfinders for
    example utilize this mechanic and recover to full only via flasks).

    Additional curse priority fixes (#4008)
    
    * Additional curse priority fixes
    
    * Update Data.lua
    
    * Fully implement curse priority trigger order
    
    * Implicit and explicit curses from rings have equal priority
    
    * Gem sockets are lower priority than item slots
    
    .. when determining curse priority, apparently. Doesn't make much sense to me, but that's what happens in-game.
    
    * Update Data.lua
    
    * Fix a rare crash in determineCursePriority
    
    * Minor style change for consistency

    Fix 'defend with % armour' master to not effect total armour value
    
    This mastery was not updated to use the use the `ArmourDefence` and `MAX` node parsing. So it was modifying the flat armour value on a character which is not how it works in game.
    Also added the condition check for `LowEnergyShield` and `FullLife` to only appear when needed

    "All Bolts in Range" mode for Ball Lightning
    
    PoB can now estimate the number of lightning bolt strikes that hit an isolated
    single target enemy and adjust its DPS estimates based on this. Additionally, we
    have added support for calculating the DPS implications of using Divergent Ball
    Lightning and its supercharged balls.
    
    Implementation Notes:
     - CalcOffence.lua: we now support having skill preFuncs interacting with the
       breakdown tables. Existing preFuncs will ignore the extra argument.
     - CalcSections.lua: added several breakdown definitions since we didn't see
       existing ones that would be appropriate for our calculations.
     - act_int.txt and act_int.lua:
        - By default, we compute "One Bolt" DPS as PoB currently does, with the
          caveat that we now compute supercharge effects whenever applicable.
        - Added a new "part", "All Bolts in Range". This activate most of the new
          logic.
        - If Ball Lightning was triggered, we assume by default that the player is
          moving constantly and on average has half the standoff distance they
          really should be using to maximize DPS. This is what we've observed people
          doing in YouTube videos of CoC + BL.
        - If it was not triggered, we assume that the player is standing at the
          optimal distance. Even if they are not, the estimates shouldn't be too far
          off if they're standing or placing their totems at an intermediate
          distance.
        - Fixed the statMap to give the superball chance. The bonuses don't scale
          with quality, just the chance (thanks to PJacek).
        - Added careful computations and breakdown details.
        - For now, we assume there isn't much rounding needed. In practice, the
          exact DPS is high dependent on exact positioning, and many users of the
          skill will be moving while doing so, so averaging instead of precisely
          quantizing seems reasonable.
        - Testing: confirmed MaXiMiUS' video results that the absolute maximum
          number of hits per cast is 13, via self-poison Kitava experiments.
            - Despite the animation lasting about 2.7s, the balls can only proc
              lightning bolts for the first 2 seconds. This is unaffected by
              duration or speed mods.
            - The proc interval is always 150ms. CDR does not affect it. Untested:
              if chill, temp chains, etc. affect it.
    
    Future work:
     - It'd be nice to confirm that bolt strikes happens at end of the
       interval instead of the start. This can have a minor effect on
       recommended positioning.
     - Any additional quantization of time and/or distances.
     - Show projectile speed and AoE breakpoints in the breakdown displays.

    Fix Projectile Attack Mod Parsing (#3851)
    
    Some skills are tagged ProjectileAttack (and Attack) but not Projectile. This generally means the skill deals projectile attack damage, but does not actually fire a projectile that can collide with terrain (e.g. Rain of Arrows, Storm Rain, Blast Rain, Toxic Rain, Artillery Ballista). In order for nodes like Lethality to correctly match these skills (while still matching all normal projectile attacks) we need to check the ProjectileAttack tag explicitly.

    Round Duration of skills to server ticks
    
    Rounds the duration of skills up to the closest server tick.
    Tested with a CWDT build that lowers skeleton duration and relies on the numbers to be more accurate.
    Also changes the duration value to use 3 significant figures as server ticks are a duration of milliseconds and not hundredths

    Fix Nightblade Crit Multi not scaling with Elusive effect (#3550)
    
    * Fix Nightblade Crit Multi not scaling with Elusive effect
    
    Nightblade's granted Critical Strike Multiplier effect reads "Elusive from Supported Skills also grants +X% to Critical Strike Multiplier for Skills Supported by Nightblade". This implies it scales with Elusive effect, and this can be confirmed in-game. This change updates the support's mods to correctly apply a scaled version of the critical strike multiplier effect to skills supported by Nightblade.

    Fix Elemental Equilibrium
    
    Added support for new EE behaviour. It disables Exposure for elements you have hit with, and applies Exposure for elements you have not hit with.
    
    This currently requires you to select at least one element (under config) before it will apply or remove any Exposure.
    
    Legacy EE is still supported. I also fixed a very old bug with legacy EE where it was behaving incorrectly at 100% crit chance.

    Fix Legion Jewel EditedNode Data Saving/Loading
    
    This fixes loading and saving multiple legion jewel conquered passives. Currently only a single modified node saves/loads properly and anything beyond the first node is discarded. Edited nodes that are not conquered or allocated anywhere in the build are pruned when the build is saved, to avoid reintroducing issue #3156 (that was technically fixed by #3229, but with.. various downsides.)

    Refactor General's Cry
    
    Fixes the following issues with General's Cry:
    
    * Attack speed was factored in with non-channeling skills even though it shouldn't.
    This gave very wrong dps readings for things like General's Cry + Shield Charge/Earthshatter/Puncture etc.
    (basically anything except blade flurry/cyclone)
    
    * Exerted attack double damage chance was not accounted for.
    
    * The cooldown of General's Cry was not factored into the dps.
    Now any source of (warcry) cooldown recovery speed will reflect an appropriate dps increase
    
    * Nodes on the tree would show weird stat diffs.
    
    * The dps of the main skill from the player (outside of the generals) was computed and added to
    the combined dps even though it shouldn't. Only the generals deal damage.

    Fixes the broken Charged Dash DPS Calculation by replacing it with calculations for each of the 3 phases of channelling, allowing the user to specify the number of stages for the release.
    It also adds a "hitTimeMultiplier" similar to "hitTimeOverride" in CalcOffence, due to CD only hitting every other attack, which I thought could be useful for some other skills.
    
    I'm brand new to the code base, and this is my first PR, so lmk if there's anything I should be doing differently.

    Fixed secondary and tertiary radii calcs for Molten Strike
    
    This commit updates the secondary (inner deadzone) and tertiary (max
    ball landing distance) radii for the Molten Strike skill. It also
    overhauls most of the breakdown display for the tertiary radius. The
    new calculations are based on the derivation from the standalone
    Molten Strike DPS Calculator (same author as this commit). Look for
    the maxBallLandingDist variable here for details:
    
        https://gitlab.com/MoldyDwarf/MoltenStrikeDPS/-/blob/master/moltenstrike.html
    
    Notable math changes:
    
     - Projectile speed modifies the distance traveled, not the landing
       area (making it basically a multiplier on radius, not on
       area). It's easy to verify this with swapping faster vs. slower
       projectiles in Haku's hideout and seeing how many tiles away the
       balls land under the two conditions.
    
     - The inner deadzone radius ("secondary radius" in PoB) cannot be
       modified in any way. This makes all of the tertiary radius
       calculations slightly trickier. See the aforementioned external
       calculator link for more details.
    
    Notable functions added or changed:
    
     - calcMoltenStrikeTertiaryRadius (new): actual calculation, including
       rounding (but using a simple assumption about how rounding is done
       for the skill)
    
     - setMoltenStrikeTertiaryRadiusBreakdown (new): does all the
       calculating and rendering of the breakdown display for the tertiary
       radius. We do both in the same place because we compute and display
       so many intermediate values.
    
     - calcs.offence (modified): now calls the two functions above when
       skillData.projectileSpeedAppliesToMSAreaOfEffect exists, instead of
       inlining some math that wasn't quite correct. Also, disables the
       breakpoint calculations for the secondary radius for Molten Strike
       since no mods affect that radius.
    
    Also:
    
     - Moved the label to the top of breakdown.area display for better
       readability and to be more consistent with other breakdowns.
    
     - Allow devs to put vscode workspace config files inside the repo
       directory.
    
    Future work:
    
     - The external calculator will be simplified after these changes are
       released to the community. Many of its form elements will be
       replaced by having users just type in the skill-specific stats from
       PoB.
    
     - If we're ever able to reliably datamine boss radii, then the DPS
       calculations from the external calculator could be integrated into
       PoB. If that ever happens, the external calculator will be retired.

    Simulation Trigger Enhancements (#2456)
    
    * More accurately simulates triggered attacks
    
    Primary bug fix: cooldowns (attack or triggers) now start counting from
    when they actually happen instead of from when they last came off
    cooldown.
    Decoupled the trigger (attack) from the server tick as per
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/ll1y91/114_hits_flicker_strike_build/gnqj242/?context=10
    This better represents almost all triggers such as CoC with a channeling
    skill (cyclone) or multistrike, CWDT, CwS, CoK, and CoD. Notably it can
    now be incorrect for CoC on 1 attack per press skill at high attack
    speeds might need to be special cased if it becomes an issue.
    
    As it can now handle trigger events that happen in the middle of a tick
    we enter uncharted waters, we know the cd can only refresh on a server
    tick but when does it start. Either at the beginning of the tick that
    included the trigger, timestamped at trigger time and prorated come the
    tick, or at the start of the next tick. I think we can rule out start of
    the next tick as that would lead to very noticable lag. I choose to
    model start of the current tick because the numbers end up nicest
    (namely preserves the general knowledge that ICDR is primarily a
    breakpoint stat). If the cooldown starts immediately (timestamped)
    instead small amounts of ICDR value vastly fluctuates depending on how well attack
    speed is synced with the server tick (in general this model leads to a
    lot of missed triggers and an annoying floating point precision issue
    so I wanted to avoid it unless proven true). Will try to get in contact
    with GGG for insight into this issue.

    Rework Malediction
    
    Malediction is a debuff that inflicts 10% increased damage taken and 10% reduced damage dealt.
    
    As of now, it is only implemented for the Occultist node as an enemy 10% increased damage taken mod.
    However, The Dark Seer is another source of Malediction and cannot be implemented the same way as we don't want those 10% to stack.
    
    This commit turns Malediction into a flag and adds support for The Dark Seer's mod that inflicts it.
    
    [v2] use modDB rather than enemyDB in doActorMisc(env, actor)

    Supreme Ego now works with non-skill Auras
    
    Previously Supreme Ego was using the same implementation as Ichimonji even though they have different wordings and effects.
    
    "Your Aura Buffs do not affect allies" vs "Auras from your Skills do not affect Allies"
    
    I separated out Supreme Ego with its own, new flag "SelfAuraSkillsCannotAffectAllies" and added it to the ExtraAuraEffect logic in ClacPerform but not the ExtraAura logic so it doesn't disable non-skill auras now.
    
    I then checked all 85 references to AuraEffect in ModCache to make sure I wasn't breaking anything and found one Banner node erroneously tagged as an ExtraAura and not ExtraAuraEffect.

    Find right slotNum when slotName contains multiple numbers
    
    Slots with names like "Weapon 2 Abyssal Socket #1" will match the first group of digits as the slotNum for abyssal sockets, which is checked against the abyssal socket count on the parent item when considering whether an abyssal socket is active or not.
    This fix ensures that we if possible match against the end of the string by anchoring the match, falling back on matching anywhere if that's not possible. This ensures that the match for items like "Weapon 2Swap" is still correct.

    Ability to load a build from commandline.
    
    The idea here is to support custom URI schemes, which pass the URI data to the executable.
    
    If the second parameter starts with "pob://" then all characters after that are assumed to be a pastebin code
     - The trailing slash is trimmed if it exists
     - The build is loaded from pastebin, decompressed, and then loaded at startup instead of the build specified in the Settings.xml
    
    This is best used with the new PathOfBuilding executable which will always pass the lua script as the first parameter (and thus all other params are pushed forward by one)
     - However, this can be tested with the old executable by specifying the path to the Launch.lua as the first parameter, and then the "pob://XXXXXXXX/" as the second parameter.

    Use skill's levelRequirement entry for minions
    
    The first element of skill level data was historically used to store the actor level requirement for a skill before the introduction of the dedicated `levelRequirement` field. This use site still reads from the first elemement and as such, compares against an unrelated value.

    Change Phys As Random, add config option
    
    - Changes how Phys As Random Element mods work internally, being calculated in CalcOffence instead of the mods themselves giving each of the elements

    - Tooltips have been made more consistent in general and several have been reworded for clarity (buff tooltips now all use the word "grants", for example)

    Re-re-update
    
    Rebased once again since it's been a while. Messed up the rebase slightly and accidentally duplicated the DoT stuff in CalcOffence. This fixes it.
    
    Also had to fit DoT changes since my original PR. Had to add an if statement that doesn't overwrite the existing output for the DoT type if the output already exists.

    - Accidentally removed this part when I was cleaning up before createing the PR.
    
    This line makes it so that if a skill already has a DoT output, it will go through all the other DoT calculations including the Total DoT output(which makes it show up in the sidebar)

    Correct Arcane Surge scaling
    
    - Causes all generic buffs to be scaled by "<buff name>Effect", which is a mod not currently used by any generic buffs that I can find
    - Adds "ArcaneSurgeEffect" parsing to use the aforementioned new scaling
    - Changes the div on the Mana Regen from Arcane Surge, because for some reason when the mod was equal to 1% like at level 20, it wasn't being scaled (but was being scaled at all other values)

    - Adds support for Awakening Level and sets an Ailment Threshold based on the "Is the enemy a Boss" setting, which is a feature that is generally unrelated to this PR but was needed to do the next thing
    - Adds a new ailment effect to the table that shows the strongest effect you can apply to the configured Boss at the configured Awakening Level

    Fix for the removable crafts remaining after editing an item.
    
    Normally, a UI control will inherit the shown/hidden status of its anchor. However, if the "collapse" boolean is set to true on the anchor, instead it will inherit its anchor's position when the anchor is hidden. This was erroneously set to true for the displayItemSectionEnchant section, making it and all subsequent sections ignore the shown/hidden property for the overall item editing display.

    Re-remove Effect of Arcane Surge
    
    Unknowingly readded this mod when doing a rebase but it's supposed to be removed so now I am removing it here

commit d94ec66fba50f22445da92fd91e9ad92c3d603bc
Author: Quotae <quota97@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 17 19:48:28 2020 -0500

    Chainbreaker support
    
    - Implements parsing and functionality for two of the mods on the new Timeless Jewel keystone Chainbreaker
    - Tweaks a couple of things I forgot to do in the last commit, namely adds an output for Maximum Rage and rephrases the tooltip in the config option
    - Technically Chainbreaker will never actually need parsed without better Timeless Jewel implementation, but this will still make it way simpler to add its effects onto a regular jewel

    Implement Maximum Rage
    
    - Moves the Rage stack calculation so it can look at the mod database. The config option now gives a useless multiplier which is used in CalcPerform to give the real Rage multiplier, limited by MaximumRage
    - Adds parsing for maximum rage

    Clamp gem options input boxes
    
    This clamps automatic gem quality assignment to the maximum valid value (23%). The gem level clamp added here is just for build saving and loading aesthetics, for practical purposes it's redundant as the level is already clamped to defaultLevel+1 elsewhere.

    Clamps the default max gem level to the default level + 1. This prevents invalid/impossible gem level comparison tooltips. Adds support for automatically adding awakened gems with any valid gem level, based on gem level user setting (previously always defaulted to 5 and ignored user input).

     - Button to anoint when editing an amulet or item which specifies "This item can be anointed by Cassia"
     - Second button for an additional enchant or anoint for items with the "Can have a second Enchantment Modifier" mod.
     - List of notables with tooltips showing what the notable does and its recipe
     - Sorting by the standard power options
    
    Added the mod "This item can be anointed by Cassia" to relevant uniques.
    
    Imported items now search the flavour text for parsable mods to include in the explicit mod list
     - Right now this should only be "This item can be anointed by Cassia"

    Fix for the "Show power" calculation thinking all nodes have more power when the impale stacks are configured to be higher than the max.
    
    The fix is to have ReplaceModInternal recurse into the parent mod list when looking for a mod to replace.
     - The logic to add the mod if it doesn't exist has been moved to ReplaceMod if the function returns false.

     - The base implicit mod is also affected, but only if the item is newly crafted after this commit.
     - Also affects crafting bench and essence mods
     - The unique rings, amulets, and belts have been manually tagged so that catalysts will work for them.

    Fix for Master of Metal using 0 impale stacks if the configured number of stacks was blank
    
    This means that the Master of Metal, Watcher's Eye with impale stacks, and the Deep Cuts notable now display the real DPS change when hovered as long as the "# of Impales on Enemy" stacks config is blank or large enough.
    
    Changes to impale:
     - Removed the clamp to 9 stacks from the config
     - If the config value isn't set, the calculated maximum number of impales is used
     - If the config value is 0, then 0 impales are used
     - If the config value is too large, then it is clamped down to the maximum number of impales
     - The "Stacks on Enemy" value in the Impale section is now properly displayed
    
    Added some useful utility functions:
     - modStore:ReplaceMod will find an exact match to the mod and update the value
     - modStore:HasMod will check to see if modStore:Sum would find any matching mods to sum up, so it can be distinguished from a result of 0.
     - Added the "countAllowZero" config type, which works like "count" but will add the mod if its value is 0. This way 0 can be distinguished from blank.

    Improve DoT skill display

    Improve sidebar "combined DPS" display
    
    - With just hit DPS and one other source(Ignite, Poison, Impale, or Bleed), both the Total DPS and Total DPS inc. Extra will be displayed
    - With hit DPS and multiple other sources, the Total DPS and Combined DPS will be displayed (the displays for Total DPS inc. Extras will go away)
    - For skills that only display an Average Hit, any other sources will show their total damage, and a Combined Total Damage will be displayed which adds up the hit damage and the total damage of each other source.
    - (Note for the above: poisons and bleeds will display their total damage for a single stack, but the DPS will indicate total DPS for every stack on the enemy)
    - Skills with both hit and inherent DoT components, like Essence Drain, will only display combined DPS with another source like poison or decay

    Fix for crash when viewing a breakdown which includes a cluster node source
    
    Cluster node ids are a bit strange
     - The cluster jewel uses a modified id that's used on the actual tree
     - The source uses the original id in the tree.lua file
     - The fix is if the source id isn't found on the current spec, then the original tree data is referenced instead.

Date:   Sun Apr 12 13:09:57 2020 -0700

    Added conditions for "UsingLifeFlask" and "UsingManaFlask"
    
    Additionally added parsing for the tree and cluster jewel nodes which conditionally activate based on being under the effects of life or mana flasks.

    Added "PercentStat" tag option for mods.
    
    This works essentially the same as PerStat, with the following differences:
     - Does not work off of thresholds, so fractions of a stat can be used. PerStat is for "1 per 25 int" whereas PercentStat is for "0.1% of life"
     - Specifies the percentage as-is, and divides by 100 for you in the calculations.
     - Displays as a percentage in the calcs breakdown, e.g. "+0.1% of life"
    
    Converted some mods which were previously changed to use "PerStat" to now use the now more appropriate "PercentStat"
     - This fixes calculation issues with mods like the "Rite of Ruin" ascendancy node for Berserker, where 999 life was 0 degen and 1000 life was 50 degen at 50 rage stacks.

    Fix for crash as described in issue #753
    
    env.minion was nil and wasn't being checked
     - The fix is to use the castingMinion which is guaranteed not nil, and will be equal to env.minion when it is intended to be used.
    
    Reproduction steps:
     - Create new build
     - Add new socket group
     - Add "Summon Lightning Golem"
     - Select Configuration tab
     - Check "Enable Wrath Aura"
     - Select Skills tab
     - Delete "Summon Lightning Golem" socket group
     - Add new socket group
     - Add "Storm Brand" to group
     - Add "Arcane Surge" to group
     - Click to try to add another gem to group
     - Observe crash

    Fix for crafted and custom modifiers disappearing from custom items when prefix or suffixes are changed
    
    When an item is re-crafted from the chosen prefixes and suffixes, the entire explicit mod list is cleared.
     - This would also clear out crafted and custom mods, so they would be lost.
     - The fix is to save off the crafted and custom mods before clearing, then re-add them after the explicit mod list is regenerated.

    Partial support for Rapid Infusion notable
    
    Specifically, adds support for the "while you have infusion" condition
     - This is based on whether the "Is infusion active?" config checkbox is checked
    
    Fix for hidden config options still applying
     - For example, if "Is infusion active?" is checked and then the Infused Channeling support gem is removed, it would still be considered active and the user could not update it.
     - Now, if the UI element is hidden, then its effect is not applied

    Fix league character filter on subsequent imports
    
    The import dialog saves the selected index of the league dropdown, but
    only applies it as a filter when the dropdown value changes. It breaks
    the following flow:
    
    1. Import -> Start
    1. Change league filter to something other than "All" (e.g. SSF).
    Character list is filtered as expected.
    1. Finish character import of jewels and items
    1. Start another import via Import -> Start
    1. League dropdown still has your selection from step 2 (SSF), but the
    character list has all characters.
    
    The bug is that the import dialog remembers the league selected index so
    it appears the filter is applied, but the logic does not pass the league
    when creating the character list. It only does this when the league
    dropdown value changes.
    
    Fix is to pass the league in both scenarios.

    Show build name in title bar
    
    Display basic information about the current build in the title of the
    window. Three flavors exist, depending on the state of the app:
    
    Path of Building
    Application is starting or in the build management view (e.g. if you hit
    "<< Back" in the UI)
    
    Path of Building - Imported Build (Gladiator)
    Build is imported from a Path of Building code, PasteBin, or from a
    local XML file. Note that "Imported Build" is literal; Path of Building
    does not store the original character name or league in its data.
    
    Path of Building - Unnamed build (CleverName, Gladiator, SSF Delirium)
    Build is imported from GGG. The title takes effect when the passive tree
    is imported. Importing just the items from a build will have no effect.

    The instructions for setting up a development environment recommend

    For example, they mention copying a generated code snippet and checking
    UI boxes, but neither of those are part of the Visual Studio Code
    debugging setup.

    Openarl 1.4.160 Changes
    
    Added support for Cluster jewels:
    Cluster Jewels can be crafted like other items
    Cluster Jewel templates have been added to the Rare items database
    Some of the notables granted by Cluster Jewels are not supported yet
    The various unique Cluster Jewels are not fully supported yet
    Note that when importing characters with Cluster Jewels, nodes in the clusters will not be allocated; this is because the game website's character API does not fully support Cluster Jewels yet
    Updated item bases and mods for 3.10
    Fixed character importing
    Various other minor fixes

    undoing commit of granted passives as someone else submitted PR for it

commit 1acdbcf2570d49853709a85ac180f317ede90412
Author: David Clamage <rangsk@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 11 11:24:57 2020 -0700

    Fix for Ascendant nodes double-granting passive points.
    
    The only effect of passivePointsGranted is to add "Grants N Passive Skill Point(s)" line to the passive.
    However, the new 3.10 tree already contains that line, so there's no need to duplicate it.

    Fixed Rage Support and Chain Hook not applying movement speed bonuses properly. This was due to an error in buildActiveSkillModList, which did not add 'Condition:CanGainRage' to the global mod list.
    
    This was fixed with a, in my opinion, slightly hacky solution - I match for "Condition" in modifier name to add to the mod list, but it seems to work without affecting other builds (Tested with a couple builds on poe.ninja, no dps or modifier changes on them that I observed).
    
    Side effect of this change is that Withering Steps now grants 'Condition:CanBeElusive' and 'Condition:CanWither' properly.

    Fixed Perandus Signet not working correctly when imported
    
    The wording on mods like "X for each <rarity> Item you have equipped" has been truncated to "X for each <rarity> Item Equipped". This would lead to Perandus Signet's respective mod not working correctly when importing a character opposed to a build. Hidden Potential was also using an outdated, albeit supported wording. Furthermore, this PR removes the old wordings that are no longer used anywhere. Reference: https://feathub.com/LocalIdentity/PathOfBuilding/+18

commit 25999ca4df88cdb0c999fe8d41730151189672ea
Author: Jack Lockwood <jacklockwood1998@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 5 19:30:19 2019 +1000

    General improvements, support Nightblade more accurately
    
    - Added a display for current Elusive effect in the Calcs tab, under Movement Speed in Other Defences, which only shows up while Elusive.
    - Much better support for Nightblade Support. Now gives Crit Multi and Base Crit Chance to attacks while using Claws or Daggers.
    - Tweaked how I implemented Elusive Effect on gems. Now is implemented specifically for Claws/Daggers on Nightblade, and is added as a global Skill Mod for Withering Step and any future gems which give the stat.
    - Are you Elusive? button works and shows up more consistently.

    Optimisation for PassiveTreeView: cache the search results.

commit f50adbc7420fafc360789873c77b026101830003

    Fix search caching bug
    
    Search results were cached on the tree nodes, but as you can swap out the tree used by PassiveTreeView that takes the search results with it.  Caching the results in the same place as searchStrCached makes sure they're kept in sync at the small cost of one more table.
